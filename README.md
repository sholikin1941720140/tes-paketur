# Company Management System API

## Overview

Welcome to the **Company Management System API**! ðŸš€ This system allows companies to manage their employees effectively, with a clear distinction between **three main roles**: **SuperAdmin**, **Manager**, and **Employee**. Each role has different access rights and responsibilities within the system.

### Key Features:

-   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  
    This system implements a clear **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** structure, where each user role (SuperAdmin, Manager, and Employee) has specific access permissions based on their role.
-   **JWT Authentication:**  
    We use **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** for authentication, ensuring secure and stateless API access. All API requests require a valid JWT token to authenticate the user.

-   **Data Validation:**  
    The system includes **comprehensive validation** for data inputs to ensure consistency and prevent errors during the user interaction with the system.

1. **SuperAdmin**:

    - Can create and manage companies.
    - Can assign managers to companies.
    - Can delete companies (soft delete).
    - Full access to manage all aspects of the system.

2. **Manager**:

    - Can create, update, and delete employees in their respective companies.
    - Can view details of employees within their company.
    - Can view and update their own profile.

3. **Employee**:

## **Authentication**

We use **JWT (JSON Web Token)** for authentication. All API requests require a valid token which is included in the `Authorization` header as `Bearer {token}`.

-   **Login:**  
    To log in and receive a token, use the `POST /api/login` endpoint. You will receive a JWT token that you will include in the headers for subsequent API requests.
